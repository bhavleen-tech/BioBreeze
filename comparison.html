    <h1>Working of Bio Breeze</h1>
    
    <p>
        <li> Air is attracted by the cooler from atmosphere.</li>
        <li> As the air enters the cooler from three of its sides all the impurities, dust particles gets trapped in algae and only clean air is blown our of cooler.</li>
        <li> As the algae are wet Therefore it will release cold breeze which will also work as Cooling factor in summers.</li>
